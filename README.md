# <Everitt-Gill-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio of my work built using React. It contains 6 projects, a method to contact me, and a brief bio.

- I was motivated to build this because I needed a portfolio to show employers
- This portfolio which will be updated periodically will be given to employers
- From making this I learned about props, components, and conditionally rendering pages in React
